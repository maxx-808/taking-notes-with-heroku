## Description:

For week 11 of BCS Full Stack Coding Bootcamp we were tasked with creating a full website with front and back end communication that saves notes that you want to keep on the website.

<a name="steps"></a>

## Steps:

first you must git clone from the repo and once in vs code, npm init as the node_modules are gitignored to speed up push and cloning. then npm install the following: inquirer, express, path, uniqid. Those are for different aspects of the project.

## User Guidelines:

Using express and inquirer, we needed to create the server part of this website and fully tie it in to the front end. Users must be able to at the least; see what they wrote in before and write more notes down.

## Test Instructions:

go into terminal and `node` or `nodemon` `server.js` (As I was working on this code, I found nodemon to be a ton of help because it will update with your saves and you don't need to control C and re node it. then you ctrl click the link to the website and your on the landing page. click get started to see and write new notes. press save icon on top right to save new notes to the list.
